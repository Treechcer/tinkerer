# Tinkerer

Tinkerer is game inspired by automatization games (factorio, minecraft mod-packs like tekkit, satisfactory...) and forager, this game will be focused on puzzles, automatization, survival (just basic survival, eating, HP...) and some RPG mechanics (skill tree/s, talking NPCs etc.)

## Current state

Now I'm in process remaking the whole game "pre-pre-alpha" because the code and framework for the game was really bad and this will be faster than just rewriting parts of code.

## Progress

If you want to see more progress look into CHANGELOG.md, there will be most changes documented in detail, some will be here in future when the game will reach some version and some gameplay features.

## Future

I want to release this game on major platforms (itch.io, steam...) and I want to have some "demo" beta or something version on my github, the full version won't be fully open-source on release, maybe it'll be fully open-source after some time after release but that is probably years away (and we will see even if it'll be release)
