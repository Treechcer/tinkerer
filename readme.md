# Tinkerer

This is my game I'm working on, it's inspired by forager and other similar survival games, I want to implement full automatization, similar to minecraft mod-packs, I'm also inspired by my favorite games like factorio, satisfactory and similar. Right now there's not much you can look in this branch, but if you want to see something, you can look into other branch `before-rewrite`, because now I'm rewriting it from scratch because I've made bad framework for the game and this is easier than just rewriting some functions (most of the things in were bad). If you want to see progress of how the game is going, look into `CHANGELOG.md` because I'll write there more.


Tinkerer is game inspired by automatization games (factorio, minecraft mod-packs like tekkit, satisfactory...) and forager, this game will be focused on puzzles, automatization, survival (just basic survival, eating, HP...) and some RPG mechanics (skill tree/s, talking NPCs etc.)

## Current state

Now I'm in process remaking the whole game "pre-pre-alpha" because the code and framework for the game was really bad and this will be faster than just rewriting parts of code.

## Progress

If you want to see more progress look into CHANGELOG.md, there will be most changes documented in detail, some will be here in future when the game will reach some version and some gameplay features.

## Future

I want to release this game on major platforms (itch.io, steam...) and I want to have some "demo" beta or something version on my github, the full version won't be fully open-source on release, maybe it'll be fully open-source after some time after release but that is probably years away (and we will see even if it'll be release)
